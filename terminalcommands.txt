ON CLUSTER:

make sure ucsd vpn(anyconnect) is running set on all through library(revelle i think, not sure it matters)

ssh into dsmlp

ssh <ucsd_login>@dsmlp-login.ucsd.edu

in base enter the following command

launch-scipy-ml-gpu.sh -i edzamora/tweetynet-project:latest -P Always -c 8 -m 64 -g 1 -v 2080ti -b

image is configured to have right environment.

configured to have 8 cores 64 memory and 1 gpu, v tag specifies which gpu type, if cluster takes a while dont specify gpu. 

-b tag configures it to be a background running pod

use kubesh to go into pod

kubesh <podname>

in pod, git pull the repo

git clone https://github.com/EdmundoZamora/TweetyNet_CUDA_GPU_Adaptation.git  

go into the repo

run the following command

python -u run.py data features model evaluate

after this any following run will be 

python -u run.py skip features model evaluate

the skip arguement tells the file to not re-download the data. also a thing im trying to investigate is deleting the best_weights.h5(in data/out) and downlsampled.pkl(in data/raw)

also on dsmlp check dsmlp status to check which pod you are assigned to.

connecting to cluster on vscode is also a better route and makes data/file transfer better.

to delete a pod, exit to base, and use

kubectl get pods

after list shows enter the following

kubectl delete pod <podname>

ON LOCAL:

set up tweety environment

after pulling the repo and being in the right directory enter the same as above (in vscode)

python -u run.py data features model evaluate

after this any following run will be 

python -u run.py skip features model evaluate


FOR BOTH: 

to observe gpu usage enter the following command in another terminal 

nvidia-smi

the table will show % gpu mem usage and temp
