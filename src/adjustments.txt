0) GET BOTH GPU AND CPU MODELS TO TRAIN ON SAME FILES AND TEST ON SAME FILES.
    - files 

    Get pyrenote processing to process nips data
        1) condense the nips annotations - DONE
    test nips annotations and training using pyrenote processing

    upload pyrenote data to cloud cluster

    pandas jpnb to select files for trainging and testing.

1) Generalizing the data ingesting, and project reproducment process.

2) incorporating the window slicing, interface, and directory management for user experience improvement
3) graphs  and htmls to a outfolder and interactive window interface.

4) uploading the rest of the pyre note data to the cluser, speed and performance measuring
5) benchmarking and citing the original work.

6) blueprinting the process for ease of future developer understanding.

7) Integrating multi class detection, ingesting entire pyrenote data.

8) user annotation clustering, categorizing complexity of data (Annotations of recordings).
